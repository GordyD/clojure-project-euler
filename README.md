# Project Euler Clojure

In order to learn Clojure I have decided to go through the problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) and find solutions for each.

## Requirements

You need to have [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) installed!

## Usage

```
lein run [problem]
```

e.g.

```
lein run problem2
```
